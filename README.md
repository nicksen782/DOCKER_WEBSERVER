## Why would you use this project?
* The goal of this project is to easily create a webserver for your local computer.
* Uses Docker with Apache, PHP, etc to host the directory this script was run from.
* After the web server is running, copy any code that you want hosted into that directory.

## Instructions To Use This Project:
* The script takes 4 arguments. All are required (even when using STOPREMOVECONTAINER.)
* The arguments, in order are: COMMAND, PORTNUMBER, BRANCH, GITUPDATE.
* See the _install._sh file (the script) for details on the ways it can be ran.

## Notes:
